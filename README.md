# Practice project for using WebRTC with Pion

### Description
Aim of the project was to create simple p2p solution with WebRTC on GoLang, which has notion of nodes (peers and coordinator) and
to have them exchange SDPs trough coordinator and communicate through WebRTC
(even though nodes might not necessarily be accessible to each other).

Project is basically extension of [Pion](https://github.com/pion/webrtc)'s [pion-to-pion](https://github.com/pion/webrtc/tree/master/examples/pion-to-pion) example,
providing additional peer discovery (through coordinator) and multiple worker modes which either send random data, works as a basic chat
or synchronizes specific directories in nodes.

### Usage
Playground can be tried out with docker containers, which can be run with `docker-compose`.
It sets up one coordinator and two peer nodes (networks configured ins such way that peers can't see each other),
containers will be run with default `rand_messages` worker mode. Peers will just generate specified number of random message
and send it to each other, for more info about flags `--help` can be run.

```
Usage of ./cmd:
  -coordinator_address string
        Address for coordinator node, mandatory field
  -coordinator_port int
        Port on which coordinator runs, mandatory field (default -1)
  -directory string
        worker : fs, directory which should be updated/monitored for updates by this worker (default "./")
  -n_of_messages int
        worker: rand_messages, number of random messages need to be generated by workers (default 5)
  -node_type string
        Determines which logic should node enforce, mandatory field
  -recursive
        worker : fs, whether subdirectories should be monitored as well
  -username string
        worker: chat, arbitrary username for chat user (default "username")
  -worker string
        Worker worker, can either be rand_messages, chat or fs (default "rand_messages")

```

### TO DO
Provide unit tests with proper coverage of codebase
